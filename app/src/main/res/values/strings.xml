    <string name="landmark1text">Bukchon is one of the oldest districts of Seoul that has survived to the present day. In Joseon times, these traditional houses with a tiled roof belonged to the Korean nobility – "Yangban". The Bukchon Folklore Village is located next to Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces and the Jeongme Royal Tomb. It appeared here almost simultaneously with the founding of Seoul more than six centuries ago. The houses of the nobility in the traditional style have come down to us almost unchanged. There is a Center of traditional culture and restaurants of traditional cuisine, visiting which you can immerse yourself in the atmosphere of old Korea. This area was called Bukchon, which means "northern village", because it is located north of the Chongecheon Creek and Jeongno Street. During the Joseon Dynasty, members of the royal family and the highest circles of the capital\'s aristocracy lived here. Bukchon includes the Woso-dong, Che-dong, Kahvedon and Insadon neighborhoods.</string>
